# Simple Node.js Project for OpenAI API Integration

This project demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API with Node.js. It includes a simple example of how to connect to the OpenAI API and send a request to the GPT-3.5 model.

## Requirements

- Node.js and NPM installed
- An OpenAI API key stored in a .env file

## Setup

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Create a `.env` file and add your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
3. Start the project with `npm start` or `node ./src/index.mjs`.

This project serves as a starting point for hackathons focused on using OpenAI.
